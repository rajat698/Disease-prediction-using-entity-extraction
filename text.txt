	36. Dry mouth, or xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), refers to a condition in which the salivary glands in your mouth don't make enough saliva to keep your mouth wet. Dry mouth is often due to the side effects of certain medications or aging issues or as a result of radiation therapy for cancer. Less often, dry mouth may be caused by a condition that directly affects the salivary glands. Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria, limiting bacterial growth and washing away food particles. Saliva also enhances your ability to taste and makes it easier to chew and swallow. In addition, enzymes in saliva aid in digestion. Decreased saliva and dry mouth can range from being merely a nuisance to something that has a major impact on your general health and the health of your teeth and gums, as well as your appetite and enjoyment of food. Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause. If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these signs and symptoms all or most of the time:
* Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth
* Saliva that seems thick and stringy
* Bad breath
* Difficulty chewing, speaking and swallowing
* Dry or sore throat and hoarseness
* Dry or grooved tongue
* A changed sense of taste
* Problems wearing dentures
In addition, dry mouth may result in lipstick sticking to the teeth.

	37. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (mak-roe-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh) is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. If you have Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, your bone marrow produces too many abnormal white blood cells that crowd out healthy blood cells. The abnormal white blood cells produce a protein that accumulates in the blood, impairs circulation and causes complications. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is considered a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's sometimes called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is slow growing and may not cause signs and symptoms for many years.
             When they do occur, signs and symptoms may include:
* Easy bruising
* Bleeding from the nose or the gums
* Fatigue
* Weight loss
* Numbness in your hands or feet
* Fever
* Headache
* Shortness of breath
* Changes in vision
* Confusion

	38. Common warts are small, grainy skin growths that occur most often on your fingers or hands. Rough to the touch, common warts also often feature a pattern of tiny black dots, which are small, clotted blood vessels. Common warts are caused by a virus and are transmitted by touch. It can take a wart as long as two to six months to develop after your skin has been exposed to the virus. Common warts are usually harmless and eventually disappear on their own. But many people choose to remove them because they find them bothersome or embarrassing.
            Common warts usually occur on your fingers or hands and may be:
* Small, fleshy, grainy bumps
* Rough to the touch
* Sprinkled with black pinpoints, which are small, clotted blood vessels

	39. A swollen knee occurs when excess fluid collects in or around your knee joint. Health care providers might refer to this condition as an effusion (uh-FU-zhun) in your knee joint. A swollen knee may be the result of trauma, overuse injuries, or an underlying disease or condition. To find the cause of the swelling, your provider might need to test a sample of the fluid for infection, disease or blood from an injury. Removing some of the fluid may help reduce the pain and stiffness associated with the swelling. Once the underlying cause is known, treatment can begin. Signs and symptoms typically include:
* Swelling. The skin around your kneecap can puff up noticeably, especially when you compare the affected knee to your other one.
* Stiffness. When your knee joint contains excess fluid, you might not be able to bend or straighten your leg completely.
* Pain. Depending on the cause of the fluid buildup, your knee might be very painful — to the point that it's impossible to bear weight on it.

	40. Wheat allergy is an allergic reaction to foods containing wheat. Allergic reactions can be caused by eating wheat and also, in some cases, by inhaling wheat flour. Avoiding wheat is the primary treatment for wheat allergy, but that isn't always as easy as it sounds. Wheat is found in many foods, including some you might not suspect, such as soy sauce, ice cream and hot dogs. Medications may be necessary to manage allergic reactions if you accidentally eat wheat. Wheat allergy sometimes is confused with celiac disease, but these conditions differ. Wheat allergy occurs when your body produces antibodies to proteins found in wheat. In celiac disease, a specific protein in wheat — gluten — causes a different kind of abnormal immune system reaction. Wheat allergy signs and symptoms include:
* Swelling, itching or irritation of the mouth or throat
* Hives, itchy rash or swelling of the skin
* Nasal congestion
* Headache
* Difficulty breathing
* Cramps, nausea or vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anaphylaxis

	41. Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that most often affects your joints and digestive system. Whipple disease interferes with normal digestion by impairing the breakdown of foods, and hampering your body's ability to absorb nutrients, such as fats and carbohydrates. Whipple disease can also infect other organs, including your brain, heart and eyes. Without proper treatment, Whipple disease can be serious or fatal. However, a course of antibiotics can treat Whipple disease. Digestive signs and symptoms are common in Whipple disease and may include:
* Diarrhea
* Stomach cramping and pain, which may worsen after meals
* Weight loss, associated with the malabsorption of nutrients
Other frequent signs and symptoms associated with Whipple disease include:
* Inflamed joints, particularly the ankles, knees and wrists
* Fatigue
* Weakness
* Anemia

	42. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. In many people, it's marked by a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like "whoop. "Before the vaccine was developed, whooping cough was considered a childhood disease. Now whooping cough primarily affects children too young to have completed the full course of vaccinations and teenagers and adults whose immunity has faded. Deaths associated with whooping cough are rare but most commonly occur in infants. That's why it's so important for pregnant women — and other people who will have close contact with an infant — to be vaccinated against whooping cough. Once you become infected with whooping cough, it takes about seven to 10 days for signs and symptoms to appear, though it can sometimes take longer. They're usually mild at first and resemble those of a common cold:
* Runny nose
* Nasal congestion
* Red, watery eyes
* Fever
* Cough
After a week or two, signs and symptoms worsen. Thick mucus accumulates inside your airways, causing uncontrollable coughing. Severe and prolonged coughing attacks may:
* Provoke vomiting
* Result in a red or blue face
* Cause extreme fatigue
* End with a high-pitched "whoop" sound during the next breath of air

	43. In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, an extra signaling pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers causes a fast heartbeat (tachycardia). WPWsyndrome is a heart condition present at birth (congenital heart defect). It is fairly rare. The episodes of fast heartbeats seen in WPWsyndrome usually aren't life-threatening, but serious heart problems can occur. Rarely, WPW syndrome may lead to sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. Treatment of WPW syndrome may include special actions, medications, a shock to the heart (cardioversion) or a catheter procedure to stop the irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). WPW syndrome may also be called preexcitation syndrome. In general, signs and symptoms that may occur in people with WPW syndrome include:
* A rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeat (palpitations)
* Chest pain
* Difficulty breathing
* Dizziness or lightheadedness
* Fainting
* Fatigue
* Shortness of breath
* Anxiety

	44. A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is an enlargement of the veins within the loose bag of skin that holds the testicles (scrotum). These veins transport oxygen-depleted blood from the testicles. A varicocele occurs when blood pools in the veins rather than circulating efficiently out of the scrotum. Varicoceles usually form during puberty and develop over time. They may cause some discomfort or pain, but they often result in no symptoms or complications. A varicocele may cause poor development of a testicle, low sperm production or other problems that may lead to infertility. Surgery to treat varicocele may be recommended to address these complications. A varicocele usually occurs on the left side of the scrotum and often produces no signs or symptoms. Possible signs and symptoms may include:
* Pain. A dull, aching pain or discomfort is more likely when standing or late in the day. Lying down often relieves pain.
* A mass in the scrotum. If a varicocele is large enough, a mass like a "bag of worms" may be visible above the testicle. A smaller varicocele may be too small to see but noticeable by touch.
* Differently sized testicles. The affected testicle may be noticeably smaller than the other testicle.
* Infertility. A varicocele may lead to difficulty fathering a child, but not all varicoceles cause infertility.
