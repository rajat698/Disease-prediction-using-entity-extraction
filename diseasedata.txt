Based on the statistics from WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,here are the five most common infectious diseases.
According to current statistics, hepatitis B is the most common infectious disease in the world, affecting some 2 billion people -- that's more than one-quarter of the world's population. This disease, which is characterized by an inflammation of the liver that leads to jaundice, nausea, and fatigue, can lead to long-term complications such as cirrhosis of the liver or even liver cancer. The concern is primarily for those who carry the chronic form of the disease, which is estimated to be about 350 million people.Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that tends to affect children the most in tropical and subtropical climates, affects more than 500 million people annually and results in anywhere between 1 million and 3 million deaths. Behind hepatitis B, it appears to be the second most-common infectious disease, and it certainly is one of the most deadly on an annual basis.

Hepatitis C is a less common and less severe form of hepatitis, but it almost always develops into a chronic, not acute, condition, unlike hepatitis B. Although only 3 million to 4 million new cases are reported each year, some 180 million people worldwide suffer from this chronic condition, which can lead to liver cancer or cirrhosis of the liver over time.
It's at times like these that we curse mosquitoes, because a very specific type of mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is responsible for the transmission of dengue to approximately 50 million people each year. Dengue is most common in Africa and Asia and thankfully occurs in only mild to moderate forms, which can cause high fever, severe headaches, and joint and muscle pain, but rarely leads to the death of the infected patient.
As I mentioned previously, estimating new and ongoing cases for some of these diseases can be downright difficult, and perhaps none more so than tuberculosis. TB is caused by a bacteria found in the lungs that can cause chest pain and a bad cough, as well as lead to a number of other nasty side effects. According to WHO, it's also the second-leading global killer behind AIDS as a single infectious agent.The majority of TB-associated deaths (95%) occur in low- to middle-income countries where TB awareness and prevention simply aren't where they need to be. The good news is that TB death rates on a global basis are falling; however, there were still 8.6 million new cases of TB reported last year, and roughly one-third of the world's population carries a latent form of TB,
meaning they've been infected but aren't ill and can't transmit the disease yet. Asbestosis is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.
Dry mouth, or xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh), refers to a condition in which the salivary glands in your mouth don't make enough saliva to keep your mouth wet
The yips are involuntary wrist spasms that occur most commonly when golfers are trying to putt.
The Zika (ZEE-kuh) virus is most often spread to people through mosquito bites, primarily in tropical and subtropical areas of the world.
Ameloblastoma is a rare, noncancerous (benign) tumor that develops most often in the jaw near the molars.
Claudication is pain caused by too little blood flow to muscles during exercise.
A goiter is the irregular growth of the thyroid gland.
Esthesioneuroblastoma (es-thee-zee-o-noo-row-blas-TOE-muh) is a rare type of cancer that begins in the upper portion of the nasal cavity.
warts are small, grainy skin growths that occur most often on your fingers or hands.
A swollen knee occurs when excess fluid collects in or around your knee joint.
Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that most often affects your joints and digestive system.
An ACL injury is a tear or sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) — one of the strong bands of tissue that help connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia).
Acute coronary syndrome is a term used to describe a range of conditions associated with sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart.
Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia — lung inflammation usually caused by infection.
Bruxism (BRUK-siz-um) is a condition in which you grind, gnash or clench your teeth.
A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is an enlargement of the veins within the loose bag of skin that holds the testicles (scrotum).
Dermatitis is a general term that describes a common skin irritation. It has many causes and forms and usually involves itchy, dry skin or a rash. Or it might cause the skin to blister, ooze, crust or flake off. Three common types of this condition are atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis and contact dermatitis.
Dermatitis isn't contagious, but it can make you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious. Moisturizing regularly helps control the symptoms. Treatment may also include medicated ointments, creams and shampoos. Each type of dermatitis tends to occur on a different part of your body. Signs and symptoms may include:
* Itchiness (pruritus)
* Dry skin
* Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
* Blisters, perhaps with oozing and crusting
* Flaking skin (dandruff)
* Thickened skin
* Bumps in hair follicles

Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.
The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.
Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.
Diabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. Some people, especially if they have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:
* Feeling more thirsty than usual.
* Urinating often.
* Losing weight without trying.
* Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.
* Feeling tired and weak.
* Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.
* Having blurry vision.
* Having slow-healing sores.
* Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.

Orchitis (or-KIE-tis) is an inflammation of one or both testicles. Bacterial or viral infections can cause orchitis, or the cause can be unknown. Orchitis is most often the result of a bacterial infection, such as a sexually transmitted infection (STI). In some cases, the mumps virus can cause orchitis. Bacterial orchitis might be associated with epididymitis — an inflammation of the coiled tube (epididymis) at the back of the testicle that stores and carries sperm. In that case, it's called epididymo-orchitis. Orchitis causes pain and can affect fertility. Medication can treat the causes of bacterial orchitis and can ease some signs and symptoms of viral orchitis. But it can take several weeks for scrotal tenderness to disappear. Orchitis signs and symptoms usually develop suddenly and can include:
* Swelling in one or both testicles
* Pain ranging from mild to severe
* Fever
* Nausea and vomiting
* General feeling of unwellness (malaise)
